                    Crecientech may transfer your personal information across geographical borders to
                    Crecientech entities or service providers working on our behalf in other countries
                    with different data protection laws that may not be on par with that of the origin
                    country. A Transfer of personal information has a broad meaning and occurs when
                    information is communicated, moved, accessed or otherwise sent to another country.

                    requirements may apply for such Transfer to be allowed.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    For instance, data protection laws of the EEA and of Switzerland authorize the
                    Transfer of personal information:
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>to countries which have been recognized by the European Commission as
                        offering an adequate level of protection for personal information.</li>
                    <li>if appropriate measures in compliance with the European Union data
                        protection legal requirements are in place in order to ensure the protection
                        and the confidentiality of personal information in the countries that do not offer
                        an adequate level of protection.</li>

                <div class="mb-3">
                    This is the case where the recipient Crecientech entity or Third Party concludes with
                    the exporting relevant entity of Crecientech an agreement based on the European
                    Union standard contractual clauses, to ensure the protection of personal information.

                    <li>Crecientech needs to carry out the transfer of personal information to perform
                        or conclude a contract with the Data Subject; the transfer of personal

                        case of a life or death situation), or (ii) to allow Crecientech to establish,
